# FitnessGoals-react
A Web-Application to put your fitness journey on paper. FitnessGoals helps track progressive overload on different exercises, weight gain or loss, calories, macro and micro nutruients, and helps set your fitness schedule everyday.

## Version 1.0 Features
FitnessGoals allows users to create a profile that they can login to whenever they need. Also features exercise
tracker that tracks exercises by day and week. Users are given the option of #day cycle they are on (i.e. 6, 7, or 8
day cycle). They will have a tile for every exercise they do each day. For exercises that repeat weakly, after week 1
each tile will have an inline text for the reps x sets x weight were completed last week so users know how much to do 
this week.
