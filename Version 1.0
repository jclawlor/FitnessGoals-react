## Version 1.0 Features
FitnessGoals allows users to create a profile that they can login to whenever they need. Also features exercise
tracker that tracks exercises by day and week. Users are given the option of #day cycle they are on (i.e. 6, 7, or 8
day cycle). They will have a tile for every exercise they do each day. For exercises that repeat weakly, after week 1
each tile will have an inline text for the reps x sets x weight were completed last week so users know how much to do 
this week.
